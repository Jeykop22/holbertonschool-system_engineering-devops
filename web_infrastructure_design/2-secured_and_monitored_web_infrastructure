- Add FireWall to Load Balancer, because load balancer is the gateway between user and server, 
Add Firewall to each Server to protect it
Install SSL certificate to secure information between site and user, redirect HTTP port to HTTPS port for encrypting data.
Add a tool monitor for each server.

- Protect the network from unwanted and unauthorized users by acting as an intermediary between the internal network and the external network

- The SSL certificate is for encrypting the traffic between the web servers and the external network. use 443 port.

-  Monitoring is a set of tool to use for analysing the performance and operations of the servers, and alert administrator in problem case. 
- Evalue every unit in the infrastructure, consider which work metrics and resource metrics are reasonably available, and collect them all.

- Install the tool Sumologic to monitor the disk I/O, MySql, Memory, Network, CPU

- SSL guarantees the security of data transported by encryption

- If the server that contains this database fails, it is no longer possible to write or update the data, only to read it.

- The components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem
