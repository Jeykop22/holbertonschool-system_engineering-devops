- I add one more server, and one Load balancer to distributes traffic volumes to each servers

- The most used algorithm with HAProxy, which selects servers in a rotating manner, according to their weight.

- An active-active load balancer distributes traffic across multiple servers simultaneously, while an active-passive load balancer designates one server as primary, with others as backups, routing traffic only to the primary unless it fails.
So ours is a active-active

- In a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) database cluster, the primary node handles read and write operations, replicating data changes to replica nodes asynchronously or synchronously, ensuring redundancy, scalability, and fault tolerance.

- The primary node in a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) database cluster typically handles read and write operations, serving as the authoritative source for data modifications. The replica nodes, on the other hand, primarily serve read-only operations, providing redundancy, scalability, and potentially improved performance for read-heavy workloads.

- If one server (and its contents) goes down, the other takes over. Heavy traffic is also regulated (but not infinitely).
Now, if the server that contains the Load balancer crashes, the system is in danger.

- The data transmitted over the network isn't encrypted using an SSL certificate. Anyone can intercept and read them.
There is no way of blocking unauthorized IPs since there's no firewall installed on any server.

- We have no way of knowing the status of each server since they're not being monitored.
